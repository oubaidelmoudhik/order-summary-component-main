## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

This challenge allowed me to understand the @media queries in CSS, also the "Flex" property which combines the flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis in flexbox. Also, I leanrned how to insert an SVG as a background.



### Continued development

I want to focus more on flexbox and CSS grid. Also I want to expand on the @media queries because they help create responsive designs and they are very interesting to me.
